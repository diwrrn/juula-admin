# Foods Database Manager

## Overview

This is a comprehensive full-stack web application for managing foods database, meals, and workout plans. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and organize food items with comprehensive nutrition information, create detailed meal plans with multilingual support, and manage workout routines with exercise categories and plans. It's built with a modern React frontend and Express.js backend, using Firebase Firestore for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with TypeScript support

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (configured but not fully implemented)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL (prepared for future migration)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **Development**: Hot module replacement via Vite integration

### Data Storage Solutions

- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage for development/testing

## Key Components

### Data Models
The application uses a comprehensive food schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`:
- **Food Entity**: Includes multilingual names (English, Kurdish, Arabic), base name for meal planning, nutritional information, categorization, dietary restrictions
- **Multilingual Support**: English name (required), Kurdish name (optional), Arabic name (optional)
- **Base Name Field**: Simple food identifier for meal planners to prevent duplicate food selection (e.g., "chicken" for all chicken variants)
- **Food Type System**: Solid/liquid classification with appropriate serving units
- **Dynamic Serving Units**: 9 serving types (ml, l, g, cup, tbsp, tsp, plate, fist, piece) filtered based on food type
- **Categories**: 9 predefined categories (fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, dairy, beverages, snacks, condiments, protein supplements)
- **Nutrition System**: 10 vitamins/minerals tracked (calcium, potassium, vitamins B12, A, E, D, C, iron, magnesium)
- **Meal Planner Integration**: Boolean field to control food inclusion in meal planning systems
- **Duplication Control**: Boolean field to allow or prevent food duplication in meal plans
- **Low Calorie Classification**: Boolean field to mark foods as low calorie options
- **Calorie Adjustment**: Boolean field to enable calorie adjustment for foods in meal planning
- **Portion Control**: Minimum and maximum portion size fields (in grams) for meal planning guidance
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe data validation

### Meals Data Models
The application now includes a comprehensive meals system defined in `shared/schema.ts`:
- **Meal Entity**: Complete meal recipes with multilingual support (English, Kurdish, Arabic)
- **Food References**: Array of food items with base portions and roles (protein_primary, carb_primary, filler, etc.)
- **Nutrition Scaling**: Base nutrition values with min/max scaling factors (0.5x to 2.5x)
- **Meal Classification**: Meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack) and difficulty levels
- **Cultural Tags**: Support for Arabic, Kurdish, Western, Mediterranean, and Asian cuisines
- **Metadata**: Prep time, difficulty, custom tags, and active status control

### Workout Plans Data Models
The application includes a comprehensive workout management system defined in `shared/schema.ts`:
- **Workout Categories**: Organized exercise categories (chest, back, shoulders, arms, legs, core) with ordering and icons
- **Exercise Database**: Complete exercise library with descriptions, video URLs, muscle groups, difficulty levels, and equipment requirements
- **Workout Plans**: User-created workout routines with multiple exercises, sets, reps, and notes
- **Workout Sessions**: Historical tracking of completed workouts with timing and completion status
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Categories contain exercises, users have workout plans and session history
- **Firebase Integration**: Nested collections following the specified database structure

### UI Components
- **FoodsTable**: Main data grid with sorting, selection, and bulk operations
- **FoodFormModal**: Form for adding/editing food items
- **BulkActionsBar**: Interface for batch operations (delete, export)
- **DeleteConfirmationModal**: Safety confirmation for deletions
- **MealsManager**: Complete meal management interface with grid view and navigation
- **WorkoutPlans**: Comprehensive workout management with categories, exercises, and plans
- **Navigation**: Unified navigation between Foods, Meals, and Workout sections

### Key Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality

## Data Flow

1. **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query manages server state with automatic caching
2. **Real-time Updates**: Firebase Firestore provides real-time data synchronization
3. **Form Submission**: React Hook Form handles client-side validation before API calls
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with toast notifications
5. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with server sync

## External Dependencies

### Database Services
- **Firebase Firestore**: Primary cloud database service
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL provider (configured for future use)

### UI & Styling
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore with development project
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV=development with specialized logging

### Production
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, esbuild bundles backend
- **Static Assets**: Frontend served from Express static middleware
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore production instance
- **Process Management**: Node.js with Express server

### Infrastructure Considerations
